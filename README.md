# PipelinedProcessor
LCache and DCache are given 1 byte per line.
Put DCache.txt, ICache.txt, RF.txt in the folder of the executable. It will produce the output files DCache.out.txt and Output.txt,
we renamed DCache to make sure multiple runs don't damage DCache.txt (convenience).
To compile: no extra options needed, run g++ main.cpp
